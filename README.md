# Hours Calendar
## Bootcamp challenge 5

### Description:
This repository contains Hours Calendar, which lets a user input events for each hour of a business day (7am - 7pm), and saves the events to local storage so they can be displayed on refresh. The time blocks for each hour of the day change color to represent past, present, and future, such that if you had the page open at 11am, the 11am (present) slot would be red, the time blocks before 11am (past) would be gray, and the time blocks after 11am (future) would be green.

### Usage:
To use Hours Calendar, simply open the app at this [link https://mwegter95.github.io/hours-calendar/](https://mwegter95.github.io/hours-calendar/), and enter text for a time block by clicking to the right of the time (ex. 14:00). After entering text, hit the save button to the right of the text you just entered. Voila! Now your day is easy to plan.
